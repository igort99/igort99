## About Me

👨‍💻 I'm a 24-year-old Master Engineer of Software and Informational Engineering who believes in the power of clean code and the magic of open source.

🚀 Proficient in **Rust** 🦀 and **TypeScript** 🚀, but I'm like a programming Swiss Army Knife—fluent in multiple languages.

🎮 When I'm not crafting elegant code, you'll find me dominating in Counter-Strike. Headshots in code and on the virtual battlefield!
